Pull Requests

PSR-2 Coding Standard - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install PHP Code Sniffer.

Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

Happy coding!
